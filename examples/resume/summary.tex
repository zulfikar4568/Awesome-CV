Currently I'm working as a solution engineer and freelancer of a software developer. As a solution engineer (include Software Engineering), I work especially in Manufacturing Execution System (MES) Software Enterprise from siemens. I solved some complex business problems in manufacturing through technology.

My passion is creating the Innovation to solved the problem and helping the people to reach their purpose. Since My background is from Mechatronics so I understand about Mechanical, Electrical, Information System. But from here I'm focusing on combination of Electrical (Embedded System) and Information System.
