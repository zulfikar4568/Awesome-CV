Experience in gathering requirements until implementing Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) Software Development based on ISA-95 standards in Discrete Manufacturing and Batch Manufacturing for 3+ years of experience. I do modeling of the factory, for example (Pyhscal, Process, Execution Modeling). The use case of what I've done such as Material Consumption and Validation, Process/Workflow Enforcement, Task Enforcement, traceability, Maintenance Management, Quality, Dispatching Orders, Data Integration from ERP Systems, and many more.
