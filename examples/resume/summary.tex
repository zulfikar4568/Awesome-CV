Currently I'm working as a solution engineer and freelancer of a software developer. As a solution engineer (include Software Engineering), I work especially in Manufacturing Execution System (MES) Software Enterprise from siemens.

I solved some complex business problems in manufacturing through technology and solve them through Programming, especially C\# and manage the integration of enterprise software to machine level like SCADA and manage server On-Premise (Windows Server). On the other hand, also I've done freelance for software development using some framework Vuejs, Rails, and other stuff , you can check in my repository Github Account
