\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
Experience in Software Enterprise (Manufacturing Execution System) from Siemens and Software Development +3 Years specializing in the fullstack development as a Web Developer, software enterprise in Manufacturing refer to ISA-95 and I manage infrastructure (Linux or Windows) Environment On Premises or Cloud (Google Cloud Platform) as well.
\lettersection{Why Cadeia.co?}
I'm interested in Cadeia.co because I see a bigger chance for me to excellent contribution with my skills in Cadeia.co. I have experience developing backend microservices EDA (Event Driven Architecture) using NestJs and also I used PostgreSQL + PrismaORM. I have experience creating Open API using Swagger Nest to expose my REST.
And also Implemented Authentication and Authorization with PassportJs and NestJs Role, I used GitHub Action as a CI (Continuous Integration) to push my docker images to the artifact registry in google cloud. And I package my container using Helm and Kubernetes and exposed it to \href{https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/vechr/vechr-iiot}{Artifact Hub}.
And for CD (Continuous Delivery) We can use Git Flux, Argo CD, or Jenkins, but I'm not created because depend on the user Environment and whether K8S is managed on On-Premises or Google Kubernetes Engine. You can check the details at \href{https://github.com/orgs/vechr/repositories}{Vechr Repositories}, this is the project open source that I'm managing.

Currently, I'm working for Consulting Company in Singapore as a Solution Engineer, Mostly my project a lot for Manufacturing especially MES, I do a lot of Process Control, Acquisition Data, Production Management, Quality, Material Management, Maintenance Management, Data Integration, and do a lot in .NET Environment. As a Solution Engineer not only Technical Knowledge is required, 
but we need to think of solutions in the process of manufacturing, and of course soft skills in communication to interact with customers, because we are vendors. I have an experience in financial products for \href{https://paymeforms.com/}{PaymeForms}  for at least 5 months in ThreeSixty.
With all my experience I believe that this is the right time to contribute to Cadeia.co.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I love new technologies and new things. My passion is to create something that is valuable, especially in software development I can create anything without any limitations so that's why I love open source as well.
I can work in a team or work independently, and I always prioritize honesty at work, please don't hesitate to contact me by email or by phone. Thank you.
